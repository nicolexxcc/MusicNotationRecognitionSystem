# MusicNotationRecognitionSystem
This is a project that emphasizes the GUI - the Graphical User Interface. We will build a gesture based music notation system. The music notation is clearly graphical and is quite structured so you will have to build classes that support that structure in order to draw it on the screen. Music Notation has the feature that it is not some toy system that has had all the difficulties removed - it is well documented, there are books written about it, and it is rich enough that we will NOT run out of things to do. The gestures, on the other hand, represent a method of user input and is intended to show you both some pattern recognition AI techniques and also to force you to think about how you want the user to interface with your system.
